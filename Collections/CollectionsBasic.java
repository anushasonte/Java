package Collections;

/*
Different types of data needs to be stored in different ways to optimize the storage and retrieval.
Collections framework has inbuilt datastructures and we can use them. 
It is a collection of classes and interfaces.

Inferfaces: 
Iterable - main
Collection class implements Iterable interface. 
Collection has three main interfaces:
1. List
2. Queue
3. Set
The above three interfaces/datastructures can be implemented by classes as they cannot be used directly.

Methods on interfaces:
1. add() : add an obj 
2. size() : gets size of that collection
3. remove() : removes an obj
4. iterate() : to iterate over the collection
5. addAll() : adds multiple objects at once.
6. removeAll(): removes multiple objects at once.
7. clear() : clears the collection


List interface:
3 classes:
1. ArrayList : just like an array but of variable size.
2. Linkedlist : chaining of multiple elements
3. Vector class : similar to linkedlist, but is thread-safe. extended by Stack (LIFO) - class

Queue interface: (FIFO)
3 classes:
1. Priority queue 
2. Linkedlist
3. Dequeue Interface -> double ended queue! ArrayDequeue class

Set interface: Collection of unique objects!
1. Hashset class
2. LinkedHashset class
3. SortedSet interface -> Treeset class -> for sorted arrangement

Map interface: Stored in the form of key-value pairs
1. Hashmap clas
2. LinkedHashMap class
3. SortedMap interface -> Treemap class - sorted as per key
4. HashTable
